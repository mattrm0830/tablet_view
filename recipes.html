       <p> These twice-baked potatoes work perfectly as a simple, crowd-pleasing entrée or as a rich side dish. It is believed that baked potatoes originate from South America, or more specifically, Peru. The Inca Indians in Peru were said to be the first to originally cultivate potatoes and when the Spanish conquistadors conquered Peru, they brought the potato to Europe.

        <li>1. Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>2. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.
        </li>
        <li>3. Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>4. Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.
        </li>
        <li>5. Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.
        </li>
        <li>6. Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.
        </li>
        <li>7. Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve Hot!
